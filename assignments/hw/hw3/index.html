				<p>In this assignment, You will be creating a mocked fake instagram (also known as a finsta) for
					yourself. We've provided some starter code (download link is below), but it's your job to fill out
					the information and make it look pretty!</p>
				<a href="hw3-starter.zip">
					<div class="download">Download Assignment</div>
				</a>
				<p>To start off, let's flesh out the information in the HTML to make it personalized and about you. Open
					up index.html in the text editor (VS Code, Sublime, etc) of your choice and fill out the following:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>In the div with the id "username", put in your name.</li>
					<li>In the div with the id "about", type one short sentence or phrase about yourself.</li>
					<li>Place one profile picture of yourself in the assets/img folder.</li>
					<li>In the image tag inside the div with the id "profile-pic", place the image of yourself from the
						step above. Horizontal photos work better than vertical ones for this assignment, although
						square ones are the best. Vertical photos will end up having a gray edge on both sides, but
						that's fine!</li>
					<li>Place up to 9 images of your choice in the assets/img folder. Horizontal photos work better than
						vertical ones for this assignment, and square ones are the best.</li>
					<li>In the image tag inside the divs with the class "item", place the images from the step above.
						<b>They won't show up yet, because we haven't done the styling for it in the next section!</b>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Now that your Instagram is all personalized, you are ready to start fixing the styling. </p>
				<p>Here are the steps to giving your Instagram some <b>visual hierarchy</b>:
				<ol start="0">
					<li>Link your CSS to your HTML file by adding the appropriate linking tag in the head tag of your
						HTML. All the steps below will be in the style.css file. Please do not unlink the .initial.css
						file, as it contains basic starter styling.
						<br><b>Note that <code>head</code> and <code>header</code> are different tags.</b>
						<br><b>Also because we haven't added any CSS to our style.css file, you will not see any changes
							to the website.</b>
					</li>
					<li>Notice that there's a small white margin around the top and bottom (and although you can't see
						it, sides). Each HTML document starts with a margin of around 8 pixels. Set the margin to 0 for
						both the HTML and body.</li>
					<li>Select the profile picture and use the border-radius property to make it a circle. Then, use the
						overflow property to ensure that the image inside the div is cropped by its parent. (Play around
						or search online to figure out what values it takes!)</li>
					<li>Follow button: add 5px to the top and bottom, and 30px to the left and right.</li>
					<li>Turn each of the posts into a square with a 120 pixel height and 120 pixel width.</li>
					<li>Create a 10px horizontal space between items.</li>
					<li>Create a 10px vertical space between each row.<br><b>HINT:</b> If you're having issues with
						vertical margins, look at <b><a
								href="https://css-tricks.com/what-you-should-know-about-collapsing-margins/">this
								link</a></b> for help!</br></li>
					<li>Add 20px of space between each of the navigation bar items.</li>
					<li>Create a hover effect, so that items will have full opacity when hovered over. It should also
						have a transition period of 0.2 seconds.</li>
					<li>Create an effect for the follow button, so the font becomes
						size 18 px when clicked. As a result, the button will become larger when clicked on.</li>
					<li>Add a hover effect such that the text of the navigation turns completely opaque when hovered
						over.</li>
					<li>In one selection, make the follow button, picture items, and nav bar items have a pointer
						cursor.</li>
				</ol>
				</p>

				<p class="caption">If you are lost during this assignment, do not fret! Post to Ed or come to office
					hours.</p>
				<p>Your finsta should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/img/example.png" style="margin-bottom: 40px">
				<div class="body-header">Reading Responses</div>
				<p>In this part of the assignment, you will be reading <b><a
							href="https://medium.com/free-code-camp/typography-can-make-your-design-or-break-it-7be710aadcfe">this
							article</a></b> related to web design principles and responding to a few questions. The
					purpose of this section is to prompt design thinking and awareness -- we are a design course, after
					all. Instructions can be found in the design_responses.html file (which is also linked at the bottom
