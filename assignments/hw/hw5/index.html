					<h1>What we'll be doing</h1>
					<p>This time, the end product will be shown first, since it's much easier to use flexbox when we
						have a visual of what we're going for. Below is the dashboard we'll be putting together in this
						assignment.</p>
					<img src="assets/images/dashboard.png" id="complete">
					<p>Hm. Looks familiar.</p>
					<p class="caption">Hint: We'll be doing minimal edits to the HTML. Your main task deals with
						<span>positioning</span> everything you see with flexbox. Most of the styling has been done, but
						you can always tweak whatever you want as long as it doesn't break things.
					</p>

					<li>
						<h1>Part 1: Reviewing The Basics!</h1>
						<p>First thing's first, let's link the CSS file using the same steps as previous assignments.
							Then, find the "Lato" font on <a
								href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started" target="_blank">Google
								Fonts</a>. Link that font
							to the HTML and be sure to include weights 300 and 400.</p>
						<p>Once that's done, you'll find a completely broken page:</p>
						<img src="assets/images/part1-1.png">
						<p>There are 6 total image that need fixing in the sidebar and dashboard header, denoted by an
							empty <code>src</code> attribute. Link each image (located in the img folder) using the
							correct file path.</p>
						<p class="caption">Hint: All fixes are denoted by a "FIXME" comment in the file. The filenames
							should correspond to the class names.</p>
						<p>Once you've finished, the page should look something like this:</p>
						<img src="assets/images/part1-2.png">
					</li>
					<li>
						<h1>Part 2: Styling</h1>
						<p>Let's move onto the CSS!</p>
						<p>Now that we've finished up the structure in HTML, everything else is in the CSS file! You'll
							find a <code>FIXME</code> comment above each section of styling that requires your
							attention.</p>
						<p>To simplify things, you'll only be making CSS edits in the "style.css" file. While you won't
							need to edit <code>main.css</code>, it may be hepful to read through its entirety before
							starting. This file does contain styles that we have not taught yet, so you are only
							responsible for those that we have covered in class.</p>
						<p>As you fill out <code>style.css</code>, refer to the image of the <a
								href="#complete">completed dashboard</a> above as a guide. You'll need to use a mix of
							CSS from past weeks, as well as the new flexbox styles, as indicated in the FIXME comments.
						</p>
						<p>You might notice that the naming convention is a bit unfamiliar. No worries! They still
							function the same as before. If you'd like to learn more about the Block-Element-Modiifer naming
							conventions used, take a look at this <a href="http://getbem.com/">website</a>.</p>
						<p class="caption">Hint: Be sure to link your CSS file if you have not already. Also, remember
							the main flex properties: <code>display: flex</code>, <code>flex-direction</code>,
							<code>justify-content</code>, and <code>align-items</code>.
