				<h1>What we'll be doing</h1>
				<p><em>Before you start this homework, make sure you watch the lecture!</em> Know what variables,
					functions, parameters, and return values are, since we will be using those.</p>

				<h1>Part 1: File Set-up</h1>
				<p>
					So far in class, we've mostly been running JS in the browser console (and we're going to do some
					more of that later in this homework too). But for this first part, let's actually properly make a JS
					file and include it in our HTML page!
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Create a file named <code>script.js</code> and put it in the <code>assets/js</code> folder. You
						will only need to edit this JS file for this homework assignment, except for the very next step.
					</li>
					<li>Now in <code>index.html</code>, we want to specify where to find the JS file, just like how we
						tell it where to find the CSS file. Put this inside the <code>head</code> tags in your HTML
						file, and fill it in with the appropriate file path:
						<pre><code>&lt;script src="FILE PATH"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
						IMPORTANT: Do not edit any other line in your <code>index.html</code> except for adding this
						<code>script</code> tag!
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>So now, when the browser loads <code>index.html</code>, it will also load the JS file. Then, as soon
					as the file is loaded, the browser will proceed to run the JS file line-by-line.</p>

				<h1>Part 2: Writing Functions</h1>
				<p>For this part of hw, we'll be writing code in the file you just created, <code>script.js</code>.
					Recall from lecture the structure of a function:
					<img src="assets/images/functions.png" alt="">
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Write a function called <code>averageThreeNumbers</code> that takes 3 arguments and returns the
						average. Here is a code skeleton:
						<pre><code>function averageThreeNumbers(a, b, c) {
    let sum = _________;
    let ___ = _______;
    return ___;
}</code></pre>
						If you are having a hard time understanding this code skeleton, break it down in terms of what
						each word represents. Compare the code with the function structure above. What is
						<code>sum</code>? What are you calculating in the second line? What do you ultimately want to
						<code>return</code>?
					</li>

					<li>Write a function called <code>createSentence</code> that takes two arguments: a number called
						<code>num</code> and a string called <code>noun</code>. The function should return a string in
						this format: <code>On average, a Berkeley student has [num] [noun]s.</code> For example: when
						you call <code>createSentence(12, "squirrel")</code>, the function should return
						<code>On average, a Berkeley student has 12 squirrels.</code> <br><br>If you have previous CS
						experience already, try doing this function with a <a
							href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals"
							target="_blank">template string</a>.
					</li>

					<li>Make a function called <code>getRandomNum</code> that takes one argument, a number called
						<code>max</code>, and returns a random number between 0 and <code>max</code> (exclusive). JS has
						a built-in function called <code>Math.random()</code> that, when called, gives us a random
						number between 0 and 1 (exclusive). Here, you want to be able to adjust the <code>max</code>
						value to a number other than 1. Take a look at <a
							href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/math/random">this
							page</a>, which contains documentation and examples about this <code>Math.random()</code>
						function, to figure out how to do so.
						<p class="caption">(You can get to that page by googling "mdn javascript random". In the future,
							it's helpful to add "mdn" to your google search, since the Mozilla Developer docs are an
							industry standard, and usually the most reliable).</p>
					</li>

				</ol>

				<h1>Part 3: Playing with the web console</h1>
				<p>So you wrote the three JS functions in Part 2, but how do you know that they output the correct
					expected result?</p>
				<p>At the end of this assignment, your <code>index.html</code> should look like this. Every time you
					refresh the page, you should see new values for each of the 5 variables in your window. Verify that
					the <code>avg</code> variable is the correct mathematical average of <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>,
					and <code>z</code>, and that your <code>sentence</code> variable is a string that uses the
					<code>avg</code> value correctly. You will also be uploading a screenshot of your web console output
					after you finish Part 3.2.
				</p>
				<img src="assets/images/console_sols.png" alt="">
				<p>If you look into your <code>index.html</code> file, you will notice that at the bottom of the page,
					there is another <code>script</code> tag that contains some inline JS that runs once everything
					above it is finished loading. Inside the <code>window.onload</code> function (a function that
					automatically runs once the window is loaded), we use <code>document.getElementById</code>, which is
					a very useful function that we will cover in the next lecture. But for now, don't worry about the
					content of our <code>index.html</code>!</p>
				<h1>Part 3.1: Function calling and variables</h1>
				<p>We need to call our three functions in order to invoke the expected action on our parameters. But, in
					order to preserve the return value from these functions, we need to store them in variables.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>In your <code>script.js</code> file, after you declared your three functions that you finished
						in Part 2, declare three new variables, called <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and
						<code>z</code>.
						Assign the return value of <code>getRandomNum</code> when <code>max</code> is equal to 20 to the
						variable <code>x</code>. Do the same for <code>y</code> when <code>max</code> is 10, and
						<code>z</code> when <code>max</code> is 13. Each line of code should resemble:
						<pre><code>let _ = getRandomNum(__);</code></pre>
					</li>
					<li>Next, we will use our <code>averageThreeNumbers</code> function. As you may recall, it takes in
						3 arguments and returns the average of the 3 numbers. Call this function on <code>x</code>,
						<code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>, and assign the average value to a new variable called
						<code>avg</code>.
					</li>
					<li>Almost there! We will then use our <code>createSentence</code> function to construct a sentence
						using the average number <code>avg</code> from Step 3 and the name of your favorite animal.
						Assign the returned string value to a new variable called <code>sentence</code>.</li>
					<li>You should now have 5 different variables (<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>z</code>,
						<code>avg</code>, and <code>sentence</code>) initialized with the return values from calling
						those 3 functions! Let's add one final line to our JS file:
						<pre><code>console.log(sentence);</code></pre>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>We're done writing our <code>script.js</code> file! Let's go to our <code>index.html</code> file in
					our browser to see what happens!</p>

				<h1>Part 3.2: <code>console.log</code></h1>
				<p>For this part, we're going to use the console. We're going to type JS code line-by-line into the
					console, so that we can really understand what is happening.</p>
				<p>For this class we'll be providing instructions for using the console and tools in Google Chrome.
					Other browsers like Firefox have their own, similar console and web developer tools, but for
					consistency we recommend that you follow along using Chrome.</p>
				<p>To get to the console:
				<ol>
					<li>Make sure your <code>index.html</code> file is opened in Chrome.</li>
					<li>Right-click anywhere on the page and select Inspect Element. Alternatively, you can cmd/ctrl +
						shift + i.</li>
					<li>Click on the Console tab shown below.</li>
					<img src="assets/images/console.png" alt="">
				</ol>
				</p>
				<p>We recommend that you have two browser windows open side-by-side, with this page on the left and
					<code>index.html</code> on the right, so that you can follow the instructions easily.
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>You should see something printed in the console log! If you don't, go back to Part 3.1 and
						figure out what you did wrong.</li>
					<li>Let's manually type some commands in our console. Our console serves as a temporary JS file,
						where we can declare variables and functions and return their values. Type out the following in
						your console:
						<pre><code>let num = getRandomNum(100);</code></pre>
						What does the console log say? Think about what this line of code does and if it is supposed to
						return any value.
					</li>
					<li>Next, call <code>getRandomNum</code> again, but this time using <code>num</code> as the max
						value, and not assigning the return value of this function to any variable.
						What does the console log say? Why is this output different from the previous step's console
						output?</li>
					<li>What is our <code>num</code> variable? Let's type this in our console:
						<pre><code>num</code></pre>
					</li>
					<li>Finally, screenshot your console log output and upload it into your assignment folder, labeling
						the image as <code>console.png</code>.</li>
				</ol>
